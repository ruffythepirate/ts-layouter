# Layouter

This repository contains logic to layout items in relation to each other. It is primarily intended to contain logic to layout graphs, but tries to be flexible enough to allow general layouting.

## Features

To be written.

## Requirements

* Node and npm
* To build or develop you will benefit from having `npx` https://github.com/npm/npx. This allows invoking of the other global npm requirements in the repository (Typescript, Jest) without having to install them.

## Usage

To be written.

## Contributing

Contributions, if they are in line with expanding functionality that can help with layout logic are welcome. Requirements for pull requests are:
* All code is tested
* Naming is consistent with project naming
* Commits are squashed and contain a clear commit message describing what functionality is added.
